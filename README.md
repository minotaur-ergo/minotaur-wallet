### Build wallet from source

- ** You must install Node 20.11 to build minotaur **

- First you must clone repo using this command:

```
git clone git@github.com:minotaur-ergo/minotaur-wallet.git
```

- Then in cloned directory install dependency using commands below

```
cd minotaur-wallet

npm i
```

- Then you must build project using command below:

```
npm run build;
npx cap sync
npx cap update
```

two last commands are synced code for android and ios. if you want to build for desktop you must enter these two commands to sync code

```
npx cap sync electron
npx cap sync update electron
```

### Android

for android build you can use android studio and open `android` directory in project. then build it with android studio or any other tool you want.

### IOS

IOS users can open ios project in code, open it in xcode and build any version they want.

### Desktop systems

To build desktop version of project you must enter to electron directory and build project

```
npm run build
npm run electron:pack
npm run electron:make
```

### MacOs

For Apple Silicon chips (M series) you must use the `arm64` build. Using the intel-based build will result in camera malfunction.

In case of **_damaged file_** error, use this command:
