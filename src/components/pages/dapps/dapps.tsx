    <h3>What is SigmaUSD</h3>
    SigmaUSD is an instance of AgeUSD protocol on Ergo.
    <br />
    <br />
    AgeUSD is a novel crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin protocol that has
    been created in joint partnership by the Ergo Foundation, EMURGO, and IOG on
    top of the Ergo Blockchain.
    <br />
    <br />
    Please note that this dApp itself is not the instance; it only interacts
    with the deployed contracts on Ergo blockchain which has been deployed by
    other anonymous community members not connected with Emurgo or EF.
    <br />
    <h3>Fees</h3>
    The SigmaUSD protocol fee parameter are:
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>1% Protocol Fee</li>
      <li>0.2% Frontend Implementor Fee</li>
    </ol>
    The protocol fee is charged on all minting/redeeming actions in the protocol
    (for both AgeUSD & ReserveCoins). The Ergs from this fee go back to the
    protocol reserves, and as such profit the ReserveCoin holders directly. In
    other words, if you hold ReserveCoins, you are not only rewarded in the
    scenario that the price of Erg goes up, but also if a lot of people use the
    AgeUSD protocol. This provides further incentives for Reserve Providers to
    ensure sufficient liquidity is always available so AgeUSD users can always
    mint AgeUSD.
    <br />
    <br />
    The frontend implementor fee is the fee that gets paid out to the frontend
    implementor who built a GUI on top of the AgeUSD headless dApp. This fee
    payout is performed automatically as a part of every mint/redeem action.
